+ make ServoMotor class keep track of the written angle, update Joint and Arm2D classes to set their initial targets accordingly.
+ make ServoMotor class periodically save their last written angle to a file, and load it on init (to avoid sudden jumps on startup)
+ reflash with standard MP firmware
+ revert back to hardware encoder
+ make arm2D automatically disable if any joint is enabled, and disable all joints if it is enabled to avoid control conflicts.
- implement web command system
- add DC motor + encoder controller
-- figure out why the entire project can't be upped at once from PyMakr (maybe firmware version)?

HARDWARE
- Make tripod base with 3 caster wheels, 1 infront, 2 behind.
- increase axle height slightly + reinforce base axle.
- Electromagnet holder
